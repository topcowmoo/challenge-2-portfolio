# Challenge 2 Portfolio Page


## Description

Welcome to my Portfolio project! I made this app from scratch so I could have my own portfolio. I was motivated to make this project so that I could have a place to showcase my work samples. It also serves as a place where potential employers can see what I can do for them. While making this app I learned how CSS flex box is used to further style my plain HTML code. I also had to troubleshoot the index code and style sheet to get the page to function how I wanted.
